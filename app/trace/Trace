Once the Administrator logs in with the right credentials, they are directed to Products page
containing list of products. The Administrator has the privileges to create, delete and update the page.
When adding a product the addProduct method is called and it presents a form for the
details of the product to fill in. When the admin deletes an item by calling the deleteProduct
the Products page gets updated and the item is being removed from the database.
